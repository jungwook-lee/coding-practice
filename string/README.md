## Notes on String Coding Practices

- Know how to write swap functions fast!
    - of course you can use either `reversed` or `[::-1]`
    - but, interviewers wanna know how I can implement without built-ins
- It is crucial to know python `string` are immutable
    - before doing any operations convert them to `list`
- Thus, you cannot simply change content and return!
