## Notes from solving tree problems:
- Being able to implement recursion problems are key in understanding much more complex problems:
  - Divide and conquer
  - Greedy / DP(dynamic programming)
  - Tree/Tries
- For iterative approaches stacks are usuful in traversing the tree
  - Sometimes 2 stacks are necessary to implement
  - Being able to formulate iterative traverals are key
- Level-order traversals are useful for:
  - Figuring out height
