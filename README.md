#### Quick Review Notes

##### String
- use join(), split() as needed

##### Tree
- Only root node has height of **0**
- **Complete** Tree are: left-leaning, filled to last level
- **Perfect** Tree are: full, complete
- Max height with n nodes of perfect tree: `log_2(n+1) - 1`
- Mas height with n nodes of complete tree: `floor(log_2(n))`
