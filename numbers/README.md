## Notes on Number problems
- For questions with digits, don't just simply convert then using `str()` or `int()`
- Try to come up with solutions that don't require frequent conversions. Even
if it is slower. For interviews they want to see how you think.

Things to practice:
- iterate through digits of integers without space
